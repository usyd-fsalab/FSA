                                        We will discuss both open problems and opportunities in hardware design. Sara Hooker will present her work on the Hardware Lottery.<br/>
                                        How do the tools we use shape the course of computer science history? The hardware lottery describes when a research idea wins because it is suited to the available software and hardware and not because the idea is superior to alternative research directions. Anna Goldie will then describe AI / ML methods that move us closer to overcoming these limitations, presenting a deep reinforcement learning method capable of superhuman chip floorplanning, the engineering task of designing the physical layout of a computer chip. By accelerating one of the long poles in the chip design process, Anna hopes to move us closer to a world in which hardware can be quickly and cheaply tailored to algorithms. In addition to the technical content, there is another focus of this talk: the speakers will also talk about their own research path and some personal stories to inspire our students, especially our female and minority students who may be confused about career options after graduation, to motivate those students who want to pursue research careers.<br/>

                                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                                        Extracting insight from highly dynamic, graph-structured data by discovering interesting patterns embedded within these graphs has many real-world applications in chemistry, networking, finance, semantic web, and social networks. This problem is challenging because most existing graph pattern mining systems only support static graphs. Moreover, the obvious solution of computing patterns from scratch after each change to the graph is prohibitively expensive. This talk introduces an update-driven approach to building distributed streaming systems for graph pattern mining on evolving graphs. First, I will demonstrate the need for a new approach to supporting evolving graphs that differs from existing static mining systems. I will present a novel graph exploration algorithm that supports differential mining to efficiently find the changes corresponding to graph updates. I will then propose several optimisations to filter out duplicate subgraphs found during exploration in a co-ordination-free manner, making it possible to parallelise and distribute exploration tasks efficiently while maintaining correctness. I will also demonstrate how to support this design with a multi-versioned disaggregated graph store that enables near-linear scalability across parallel workers. Finally, I will present Tesseract, a system implementing these techniques that achieves order-of-magnitude performance improvements over the state-of-the-art.

Laurent is particularly interested in designing and implementing large-scale, high-performance, resource-efficient computer systems for big data analytics and machine learning. His current research also explores the feasibility of leveraging machine learning techniques to specialise systems and components. During his Ph.D., he built the Chaos graph processing system, which currently holds a record for the largest graph processed by computer. Before starting his Ph.D., Laurent co-founded LakeMind, a cloud service troubleshooting company, in 2012. He earned a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. from EPFL in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

                                        We need to make it easier to design custom accelerators, especially for reconfigurable hardware (i.e., FPGAs). The current mainstream options are hardware description languages (HDLs), which are low-level languages that make it feel like you’re wiring up a circuit by hand, and high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, which compile legacy software languages like C or C++ to an HDL. We find empirically (and unsurprisingly) that the semantic chasm between C++ and hardware circuits comes with myriad correctness and performance pitfalls.
                                        A better alternative is possible if we re-imagine the system stack for hardware accelerator design. Our lab at Cornell is building a set of languages and tools around a central theme of *predictability:* the idea that the cost model should be “obvious” in the source language. When optimality and predictability conflict, we pick the latter. This talk will focus on three pieces of this effort: Dahlia, an alternative to C-based HLS with a type system that enforces predictability; Calyx, a mid-level intermediate language for building DSL-to-RTL compilers; and Reticle, a low-level program representation for compiling to modern FPGAs and their hardened logic blocks.

                                        Bio: Adrian Sampson is an assistant professor in the computer science department at Cornell. He works on programming languages, computer architecture, and the abstractions that separate them. He previously worked on approximate computing, the idea that we should allow machines to expose errors to some kinds of applications as a trade-off for computational efficiency. He sees approximate computing as an instance of a broader breakdown of airtight distinctions between hardware and software concerns.

                                        In this talk, we discuss machine programming (MP), which is principally aimed at the automation of software development. We discuss how our research team, Machine Programming Research @ Intel Labs, is working toward new ways to automatically develop software based on two key tenets. Those tenets are: (i) improving software developer productivity and (ii) improving software quality (e.g., correctness, performance, maintainability, etc.). We discuss MP across three pillars: intention, invention, and adaptation. We also discuss the criticality of data for MP systems, which we believe is foundational to all MP systems. We close with some recent MP systems that we have built that have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in code semantics similarity, debugging, and optimisation, including real-world results on production-grade deployed software systems.

                                        Justin Gottschlich is a Principal AI Scientist and the Founder & Director of Machine Programming Research at Intel Labs. He also has an academic appointment as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Justin is the Principal Investigator (PI) of the upcoming Intel/NSF Machine Programming Research Center and was previously the co-founder and PI of the Intel/NSF CAPA Research Center. He co-founded the ACM Machine Programming Symposium (MAPS) and serves as its Steering Committee Chair. He is currently serving on two technical advisory boards: the 2020 NSF Expeditions “Understanding the World Through Code” led by MIT Prof. Armando Solar-Lezama and Inteon, a new machine programming (MP) venture wholly funded by Intel. Justin received his PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Colorado-Boulder in 2011 and has 40+ peer- reviewed publications, 50+ issued patents, with 100+ patents pending. Justin and his team’s research have been highlighted in venues like Communications of the ACM, MIT Technology Review, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.
